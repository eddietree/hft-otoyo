OTOYO is a small jam toy that can be played by 1-3 people. Each person who connects will be assigned a role -- drummer, bassist or synth.

Built with [HappyFunTimes](https://github.com/greggman/HappyFunTimes/), a Javascript lib for builting local-multiplayer party games. Features real-time audio synthesis via the [Tone.js](https://github.com/TONEnoTONE/Tone.js/) library.
